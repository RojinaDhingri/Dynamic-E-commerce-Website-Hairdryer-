# Dynamic-E-commerce-Website-Hairdryer-
The Hairdryer &amp; Straightener E-commerce Platform is a dynamic web application that shows the main features of an online shopping system.
The project follows the Business-to-Customer(B2C) model, where products such as hair dryers, straighteners, curlers, and other hair stylingtools are directly sold to customers through an online store.
The system is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and helpful for browsing products, placing orders, and managing transactions in a digital way.
The system is built using PHP for the server-side, MySQL for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. 
These technologies work together to connect the user interfacewith the database and make the system run smoothly.
The main features of the system include product browsing, customer registration, shopping cart, order processing, and dashboards for both customers and admins/vendors to manage products, users, and orders.
